# YT_scrape_script
#### That's a very practical script, that i used for a specific task, and realized i could generalize to serve a more general purpose

what it does is that given a youtube channel, it builds a dataset from the channel's uploads, using youtube's API.
the final dataset looks like the following

the file is outputted in the current directory under the name: data.csv

you provide the youtube's channel's ID in the script:

that's it, then you run the script.
